# üìà LSTM Stock Price Prediction App

This project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to predict future stock prices based on past trends. It includes technical indicators like RSI and Moving Averages as features and is deployed as a live, interactive web app using Streamlit.

## üìã Features

* **Time-Series Prediction:** Uses a Keras/TensorFlow LSTM model to forecast stock prices.
* **Feature Engineering:** Enhances the model's accuracy by using the **20-day Moving Average (MA)** and the **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** as input features.
* **Interactive Visualization:** Displays the *Actual* vs. *Predicted* prices on an interactive Plotly chart.
* **Model Details:** Shows the complete architecture of the trained neural network.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python:** The core programming language.
* **TensorFlow / Keras:** For building and training the LSTM neural network.
* **Streamlit:** To build and deploy the interactive web dashboard.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and processing.
* **Plotly:** For creating interactive, web-based charts.
* **yfinance:** To fetch historical stock data from the Yahoo Finance API.
* **TA-Lib:** For calculating technical analysis indicators (RSI, MA).
* **Scikit-learn (MinMaxScaler):** For normalizing data before feeding it to the model.
